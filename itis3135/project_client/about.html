            <P>
                Welcome to <em>My World</em>, a platform created by food lover and culinary enthusiast, <strong><em>Zahra Zynab</em></strong>.
            </P>

            <p>
                Our mission is to provide a space where individuals who share a passion for cooking and baking can come together to share knowledge,
                experiences, and inspiration. We aim to foster a community that encourages exploration and creativity in the kitchen.

                This Site was born out of <strong><em>Zahra's</em></strong> love for food and her desire to connect with others who share her passion. 
                As a student pursuing a double major in Hospitality Management and Food and Beverages at <strong><em>ECU</em></strong>, Zahra saw the 
                potential for a platform that would bring food enthusiasts together. She began working on the website in <em>2023</em> with the help of
                <a href="https://rmalek98.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Malek</em></strong></a>, thriving for a community of food lovers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When she's not studying or working on the website, <strong><em>Zahra</em></strong> enjoys watching cooking shows, trying out new recipes, practicing yoga, working out, 
                and taking care of her skin.
